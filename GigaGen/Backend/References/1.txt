Here are some potential positive impacts of your idea:

Education and Moral Development: Providing engaging stories with morals can be a valuable 
    educational tool, especially for children and young adults. It can contribute to character 
    development and ethical understanding.

Cultural Preservation: Incorporating content from ancient scriptures and cultural texts helps 
    preserve and promote cultural heritage. This can foster a sense of identity and appreciation 
    for diverse traditions.

Accessible Wisdom: Making moral teachings more accessible through modern technology ensures 
    that valuable insights are not confined to specific books but are available to a wider audience.

Community Building: Stories often have the power to resonate with people on a personal level. 
    Your project could potentially contribute to community building by fostering shared values and 
    discussions around moral themes.

Promoting Positive Behavior: If the stories are designed to address contemporary issues and 
    challenges, they have the potential to inspire positive behavior and decision-making in 
    real-life situations.
