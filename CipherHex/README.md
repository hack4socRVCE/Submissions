ActivityChain is a blockchain based Activity Points management system. It uses Solidity to run contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, PHP to run scripts on the server side and Node.js to interact with the blockchain.
Admins have access to the database directly through which they can manupulate students' activity points and on the other hand, students can login to view their activity points but do not get the privelege to change them.
