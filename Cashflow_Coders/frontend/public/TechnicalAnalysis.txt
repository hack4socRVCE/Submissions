## Technical analysis

 Stock market technical analysis is a way to study and predict the future price movements of stocks by analyzing historical data and patterns. It involves looking at charts, graphs, and other indicators to try to understand where the stock price might go next.An analogy to help you understand technical analysis is by comparing it to studying the weather. Just like meteorologists study weather patterns and past data to predict future conditions, technical analysts study charts and past stock data to predict future stock prices.

For example, let's say you have a favorite ice cream shop. You notice that every time it rains, fewer people visit the shop, which affects their sales. By keeping track of how rain influences customer behavior over time, you can predict that on rainy days, the shop will likely have fewer customers. Similarly, technical analysts study patterns in stock prices to predict if they will go up or down based on historical data.

Here's a verifiable fact: One common indicator used in technical analysis is called the moving average. It calculates the average price of a stock over a specific period, like the past 50 days. Traders use this indicator to identify trends and potential buying or selling opportunities.



 Imagine you are vacationing in a foreign country where everything including the language, culture, climate, and food is new to you. On day 1, you do the regular touristy activities, and by evening you are very hungry. You want to end your day by having a great dinner. You ask around for a good restaurant and you are told about a nice food street which is close by. You decide to give it a try.
 To your surprise, there are many vendors selling different varieties of food. Everything looks different and interesting. You are absolutely clueless as to what to eat for dinner. To add to your dilemma you cannot ask around as you do not know the local language. So given all this, how will you make a decision on what to eat?
Well, you have two options to figure out what to eat.
## Option 1: 
You visit a vendor, figure out what they are cooking / selling. Check on the
ingredients used, cooking style, probably taste a bit and figure out if you actually like
the food. You repeat this exercise across a few vendors, after which you would most
likely end up eating at a place that satisfies you the most.

The advantage with this technique is that you know exactly what you are eating
since you have researched about it on your own. However on the flip side, the
methodology you adopted is not really scalable as there could be about 100 odd
vendors, and with limited time at your disposal, you can probably cover about 4 or 5
vendors. Hence there is a high probability that you could have missed the best
tasting food on the street!


## Option 2: 
You just stand in a corner and observe all the vendors. You try and find a
vendor who is attracting the maximum crowd. Once you find such a vendor you
make a simple assumption -‘The vendor is attracting so many customers which
means he must be making the best food!’ Based on your assumption and the
crowd’s preference you decide to go to that particular vendor for your dinner.
Chances are that you could be eating the best tasting food available on the street.
The advantage of this method is the scalability. You just need to spot the vendor
with the maximum number of customers and bet on the fact that the food is good
based on the crowd’s preference. However, on the flipside the crowd need not
always be right.
If you could recognize, option 1 is very similar to Fundamental Analysis where you
research about a few companies thoroughly. We will explore about Fundamental
Analysis in greater detail in the next module.

Option 2 is very similar to Technical Analysis where one scans for opportunities
based on the current trend aka the preference of the market.
Technical Analysis is a research technique to identify trading opportunities in
market based on the actions of market participants. The actions of markets
participants can be visualized by means of a stock chart. Over time, patterns are
formed within these charts and each pattern conveys a certain message. The job of
a technical analyst is to identify these patterns and develop a point of view.

Like any research technique, technical analysis stands on a bunch of assumptions.
As a practitioner of technical analysis, you need to trade the markets keeping these
assumptions in perspective. Of course we will understand these assumptions in
details as we proceed along.

Also, at this point it makes sense to throw some light on a matter concerning FA and
TA. Often people get into the argument contending a particular research technique
is a better approach to market. However in reality there is no such thing as the best
research approach. Every research method has its own merits and demerits. It
would be futile to spend time comparing TA and FA in order to figure out which is a
better approach.

Both the techniques are different and not comparable. In fact a prudent trader
would spend time educating himself on both the techniques so that he can identify
great trading or investing opportunities.



## Key Assumptions of TA: 

Markets discount everything: This assumption posits that all known and unknown information, whether public or insider, is already reflected in the current stock price. For example, if an insider buys a large quantity of a company's stock in anticipation of positive quarterly earnings, the price will adjust accordingly, revealing potential buying opportunities to technical analysts.

The 'how' is more important than 'why': Technical analysts prioritize understanding how the price reacts to market events rather than delving into the reasons behind those events. For instance, instead of questioning why an insider bought a stock, the focus is on how the price responded to that action.

Price moves in trend: This assumption asserts that significant market movements occur in trends. Whether up or down, trends form the foundation of technical analysis. For example, the gradual upward movement of the NIFTY Index over 11 months from 6400 to 7700 exemplifies the concept of trend-driven price movements.

History tends to repeat itself: In technical analysis, price trends tend to repeat due to consistent reactions from market participants. Human behavior leads to similar responses to price movements over time, regardless of whether the market is trending upwards or downwards.

The Indian stock market operates from 9:15 AM to 15:30 PM, witnessing millions of trades during this 6-hour 15-minute session. With trades occurring every minute, it's impractical for market participants to track every single price point. Instead, focusing on a summary of trading action is essential.

Tracking the open, high, low, and close prices provides a comprehensive summary of the day's price action:

## Open: 
The first price at which a trade executes when the market opens.
## High: 
The highest price at which market participants were willing to transact during the day.
Low: The lowest level at which market participants were willing to transact during the day.
Close: The final price at which the market closed. It indicates intraday strength and serves as a reference point for market sentiment and the next day's trading.
Among these, the closing price holds particular importance in technical analysis. It reflects market sentiment and helps traders gauge whether it was a positive or negative day. Analyzing these key data points—open, high, low, and close—is crucial for technical analysis, guiding trading decisions and market analysis.
