LASER is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated
Emission of Radiation. Laser device produces a beam of coherent,
monochromatic, intense and directional light. Hence laser light is
highly organized when compared with the ordinary light. This is
because the waves of a laser beam move in phase with each other
travel in a narrow path in one direction. In the case of an ordinary
light it spreads out, travels in different directions and hence it is
incoherent. On account of the special properties, lasers are the most
versatile and exploited tools in different fields such as Engineering,
Medicine, Defence, Entertainment, Communication etc., Other
common applications of laser include reading the bar code, cutting and
welding metals, displays in light shows, playing music, printing
documents, guiding missile to its target and so on.
