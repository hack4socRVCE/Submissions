Examination phase just got over and (KRISHNA) entered a new phase of college life. A young and ambitious personality wanted to join the cultural society and wanted to actively work for them from the very early days of his college. In order to be in the shortlisted ones he was supposed to enrol by introducing himself and his academics via email to his seniors.
Hardly had he prepared the E-mail when one of his senior called him and gave him a task of gathering the sponsors for the upcoming event that was going to be held before freshers orientation. Having mere knowledge on gathering sponsors (Krishna) decided to sort some of the emerging startups of the area and pitching them the details of the event via E-mail. He gathered pitching content from internet but was struggling to present it in a commercial way. Thatâ€™s when a helping hand stretched towards him.

Saurav, a 4th year student approached him and got to know the situation he was facing. He shared a Youtube video to (Krishna) and asked him to follow this to design a good e-mail , along with that he even forwarded him the format of a unique E-mail which he used to send to society leaders when he himself was a fresher.

Following his senior advices (Krishna) framed both the E-mails in an impressive way and even succeeded in both of his tasks.
What kind of E-mail would have been written by (Krishna)??
