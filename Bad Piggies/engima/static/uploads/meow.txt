Consider three energy levels E1, E2 and E3 of a quantum system
of which the level E2 is metastable state. Let the atoms be excited from
E1 to E3 state by supply of appropriate energy. Then the atom from the
E3 state undergoes downward transition to either E1or E2 states rapidly.
Once the atoms undergo downward transitions to level E2 they tend to
stay, for a long interval of time, because of which the population of E2
increases rapidly. Transition from E2 to E1 being very slow, in a short
period of time the number of atoms in the level E2 is far greater than
the level E1. Thus Population inversion has been achieved betweenE1
and E2 . The transition from meta stable state to ground state is the
lasing transition. It occurs in between upper lasing E2 and lower lasing
level E1
