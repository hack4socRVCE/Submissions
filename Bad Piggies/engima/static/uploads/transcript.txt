when my fellow YouTubers need help they know who to call not them me and based on electroboom setup he should have done it a long time ago you have 6 million subscribers and you make your videos on power adapter looks like a fire hazard you shut down the computer now well no more Jes and llen electroboom is getting an upgrade courtesy of origin PC who is sponsoring this video and will be giving away one of their PCS to one of our TV a camera streaming gear I knew if I believed in Santa his elf would show up how are we going to get this all in you all of it what uh or maybe we could give you all of it but you have to earn it please sir ah what did you say before we get started on the room upstairs we want to and this is your network closet and tucked away the place looks amazing but in it Nest thermostats got uh wait no I have a Wi-Fi for upstairs and a going to get all that sorted out with automatically roam between all the different access points and one name for the entire house one name for the entire house everyone will be named medy ah this that works but a question that I you planning to share any of it with the other medes who live here you know I mean you have a family right I do but I mean I keep as much as I can for myself we got you a desktop what do you need the framework laptop for oh that one that one I think my daughter can use that one although I also dropped mine I know I also have a problem with that now you would think that since lonus is an investor in framework he would know every inner working about the laptop but medy I want you to put him to the test I think you had enough gear already it goes from a zero to a once he gets the boot you hit the button what I get shocked no matter what I do yes sir I would do anything for my craft ow button yet yeah just just testing you know we have to do a test run always I started the timer you better get on what is this a notebook well the DIY Edition comes with everything disassembled so you have to put it together yourself that way you could choose if you wanted to bring your own Ram or your own SSD if you build it if you build it yourself the first time can you not stop throwing stuff around okay then you will be amply prepared for any repairs or upgrades that you might want to do in the future the end wait till the end no wait till the end here you unbox this make yourself useful okay ID the Idle Hands with 16 gigs of ddr4 from crucial ESD protected or something am I not going to should I test to see if it is prot no no no no oh personally I like to have the mouse my usba on the ow ow damn that really hurts stop dropping my stuff okay ow uhoh power adapter give me the power adapter I had nothing to do with that yay go ahead hit him ow ow damn me see how it feels on the neck what the hell that I told fine with you know consenting adults playing around with this but putting this on a dog not cool your neck is red yeah because he hit it like four times lot of fun okay can you figure out the monitor mounts yep you can put together the chair yep and uh can you figure out take care I always try meanwhile a wild Jake appears hi I see we are fixing up the networking we got a Poe switch this is that 10 this is the 10 gig one does he need a 10 gig switch for for the then the network closets are going to get a Poe switch and some access points the most sense he has a lot of cables in there right now and I have like the exact amount I need probably these things are sick have you seen these before no what is this this is a U6 6E access point but it also has a switch that but these are like the best thing ever for behind a TV not that we would normally recommend putting an access point behind a large metal object totally fine meanwhile medy have you ever built a computer before nope broken computers before you are going to build a computer usually you start with the motherboard uh is that the motherboard absolutely this is going to be for your Nas origin sponsored this video so they sent over a sick gaming editing PC you some guy smells new valve just issued a warning about this and I was like who would who needs this warning about what smelling the board yes I always smell my board smelling the exhaust of their board is broken or not right out of the gate this is a little bit of a hard mode build because this very unusual motherboard from ASRock rack has an am4 it comes with a back plate and a cooler mounting pattern that would be for Intel so in order to get a cooler on this thing Jake had to pry this back plate off which was glued thank you very much ASRock rack and he knocked off this resistor what I want a refund sure thank you traditional the first thing we because Intel mounting okay I need to oh there this is yes and that goes with the triangle but you got to lift up the arm first oh lift up the arm first yeah yeah okay arm goes down computer belt this is a really special SSD that uses of in between storage and Ram uh and you putting in a screw with your hand no you have what is in my humble opinion the screwdriver there you go this is a really cool case from think it looks flipping awesome and it can fit up to eight hard drives in the engineer I can do anything oh crap we wait you guys are using our cable goal okay good cuz we have new cable management products that are have been awesome this guy right here onto this header right there okay okay first thermal compound though okay hold on wo never built a computer before this is so in how tight do I make it I just keep going just keep going something breaks wait hold on it looks like this hold down is bent I just eyeballed it you did well this is bent but that was probably computer you can do whatever you want like new normally you would just do this up the whole way but because of the weird janky mounting mechanism on this to flex the bottom of the socket down potentially deforming or breaking those traces I have personally killed motherboards like this that have sort of weird mounting mechanisms not realizing that it was being overtightened because two 110 mm M do2s so you can get some higher capacity or high performance ones that are a little longer than the have an onboard pcie switch that allows you to just use it in any slot you want this one requires a motherboard that supports bifurcation they do have one like that as well so appreciate you startech thanks for sending this this is a perfect opportunity to show you the system that origin PC sent over what okay what did they put in there yeah no memory an RTX 490 so this is as powerful as it gets play games at all not really well I I play tatri like I said Corsair kitted this thing out with a whole bunch of their IQ link RGB no no this is just the beginning just just just just just just wait for it wait for it things are going to get it has its own display yeah things are going to get crazy in here what happens if I open this tab here H drain the system all this stuff links up together with dramatically simplified cabling compared to previous RGB Solutions and that was a big thing that corer and origin PC wanted us to talk about because it is simpler than ever to wire up a system like this in the past you would have had to be an electrical engineer to set up some of the RGB this is relatively straightforward like the fans for example just clip in together and then you just plug in the one end and all the RGB signaling and power just runs through that click-in connector can you play Tetris on that weird as it is to put a unibrow on the CPU Cooler origin PC is giving you a right you can win the PC we gave Electro boom including that core I 914 900k and an RTX 490 all you need to do is follow the link on your screen or head to the first link in the description for your whatever you want on the CPU Cooler screen thanks again origin PC now back to the video I think we need to answer a lot of questions about where things go before we go any further I had a plan for anything can be mounted on a ceiling or something what do you me you even building what is that looks like a a time bomb I made it for one of my your projects where it just blows up without a timer yeah at least you can anticipate on the voltage maybe we need to move them some things out before we bring anything in want to challenge him to a game so he you guys will choose randomly which one not a game yes it is and we are going to put it on the lower settings so are you sure yeah okay wait no shoot ah crap no starting with 10 what 10 no no no thank God all right one one round give me the callers back oh we which one matter here you go all right hold it on losing so I guess so I can still win you no three ow my NE muscles I can still win this which one do you guys want oh that hand I mean do you guys want to okay all right okay oh my God please yield I yield take as much stuff as you want this thing is so cool but it has no way to mount it I mean maybe I maybe it yeah oh LT Cable Management things and in the thing and when you want to take this off if you have something bigger little on the short side so this is more for power bricks this is the one you want to use so the cable tie goes on can mount anything you want banana you just wrap it around and then Bippity bity magnetic banana your assembly time did you want to put some shelves there maybe or maybe we can put shelves under this and then stuff go in front of is this always your decision-making process this is uh wow this takes a long time yeah we does he does we have the first of your monitors though Zenon these are OLED 27 in and they do 240 frames a second for the gaming you said are actually amazing monitors and we to get these going here is your shelf going to have so much more storage I have my beautiful tiny St binder oh this is one of those magnetic ones yes there hey we found a St actually put this here is it not too close to the door drywall anchors all the time I to level up our installation game wait he got the cool job I feel like a sucker wow that really uh that really goes that really sucks yeah and then hole back there and you screw into that stupid like that screws um yeah they uh hole ik oh no the Ikea hole we can to hold it like that I mean I could get the vacuum all right because the theme of the day is not finishing anything before we move on to the next thing now seems like a good time to talk about this musical instrument where do you want the TV mounted in here idea there used to be a crap TV mounted on the wall oh wow and a crap mount for it I already have the yeah you know for someone who was lecturing me about stud spacing and you know handyman stuff I um oh one of them is in this do the other height you know how nobody likes to sit in the front row of the theater yes okay do that I noticed your other TV is above a fireplace and my mind exploded what good at least the shelves are holding up yeah and and none of the togglers fell into the one Toggler fell into the wall did it display port cable just because this is just an Uplink for the hub for data so this handles all of your actual display data yeah no not awesome look how strong they wife to have an access point in our try this that looks not like green this with orange orange okay okay cool yeah with the frame TV the Samsung uses this one connect cable and basically you just put this one cable into the back of the TV it runs to this box here and with this box here this is where you can put all your inputs of HDMI ethernet uh connects power pretty much everything comes through this this box here just want to work safe Hazard totally ate it you think onong one but it does and I messed up so what the hell dude you know you told me that this was no problem all of your power bars plugged into Power Bars but you know what I see what do you see I this side well that problem is me not the series power connection that that your problem probably have seen it in one of my videos but wait these two were already plugged into another power strip to be clear Med is an electrical engineer he add up the total current of all the downstream devices on all of his different octopuses that are connected exceed the maximum amperage that you know each one of these sockets can support except that even though he does lot of mistakes what do what the hell what is this I I I I needed the ground connection I use that for when I walk on my treadmill because I noticed I pick up charge when I walk on the threadmill and I have my headphones in which is connected to the laptop which is connected to the ground the ear so I had to ground myself these are better for running cable along the direction of the magnets am I the first person to receive this actually things you are the first person outside of Linus Media Group to try these okay I went to spin this drill and like it just popped through the drywall like well it might be me but why do all TV companies suck at make making mounts your TV is IP TV or like TV over IP like the internet in a normal internet the packet directly to the Target you very inefficient if you had a thousand targets right so instead they use multicast which is kind of like a shotgun it shoots all over the place it really your ISP provided router does know to look for that and so does the unify ones if you turn on igmp proxy which is what we did and it works which have any of the ISP crap we can just have our full ubiquity Network up here which is way more ports than he need as you can see there is four plugged in I left a couple extra cables over here if TV is still on the floor did you really wall realistically if you ever watch watched our Channel you would have known better than to let him put holes in the wall I would have known better your seriousness though we tried to use that compatible with this TV after I had mounted the wall plate so then we tried the included frame Mount which is these two brackets here yeah they look great they look great the problem is is the drywall anchors they give you they just free Spin oh yeah okay as long as the TV uh the TV is only pulling down right the gravity is going this way if it was going sideway I would be worried we also chose the mount that makes it as close to the wall as possible so ideally you yeah so yeah okay so yeah all we have to do is we have to line these bolts yeah and up with the circles there oh I think I got it oh see now you can go sideways oh yeah you can adjust it that I told you if you get some of this clutter out of here a little bit and it really makes the space feel bigger this is awesome sweet cool well we actually have to plug it showed earlier if I can turn back down were until 6 months ago oh my God how know I just booted up my Wii for the first time in 2007 it really does actually really lose the brightness on certain put on your lab like you normally do right compared to my old transmitter from Road perfect oh wow uh everything gotten a little smaller yeah wait we at what is oh my es now with the new computer I can edit in 4k too oh oh yeah 100% it this this thing is going to chew through 4K no wireless Pro is that it has the pass through to your camera so you can monitor your audio and you can just edit directly with that but this pack acts as both a transmitter and a local recorder wrong at least you have the backup audio if you if you the recording here yeah very first zap in 4k hey oh my God he Zapped me did you see that I almost dropped the camera man what do you mean almost dropped it you dropped it well my reflexes are very fast so I caught it in mid a and then somehow we ended up bringing you a Galaxy s23 phone how does that um how how did we get scammed into this exactly and you shall receive although my old gen cheers I was told apparently you use your phone for videos though like occasionally just I do but this one does 1080 all right so I see you okay just take it actually what I want to talk about first is this chair I was there I saw it had strong wife approval Factor she said she actually liked it uh is this going to fit here this is this is well as long as the door closes oh yeah if you push hard enough yeah the handles turn I just turned your monitors to 240 HZ so just go ahead grab your mouse and just grab this window and drag it around have you ever tried this before Oh my actually find a high refresh rate display just makes everything feel like like I may just use the computer more responsive move Windows around with it oh hey and the thermal camera Works look camera that gets the infrared image and then it just kind of superimposes them same place so you can see as I move around like my eyes kind of You Wobble they kind of wobble around cuz the camera is have different frame rates right the thermal camera refreshes at a much lower rate but the game that looks good right yeah like the speed is super smooth origin PC wicked fast great cooling you barely hear this thing oh my nas off of the do you know how easy it makes video editing for me this is so good thank you uh yeah I guess now is a good time to thank origin got a giveaway you guys can check that out down below um another opportunity for us to talk about IQ link all the cool RGB software so you can download that and you can set it up to have all kinds of different colors or maybe your kids can play with it this is about as top of the line As It Gets Elijah is a sweet precious boy and we must protect this was going to go oh this bad boy goes on the table here yeah and then and then wait what on this table yeah see I I I made some planters there if I had this it would make life easier and maybe the craftsmanship would be a little more exciting you know I was just doing it by awesome do you guys remember the before in here yeah that looks awesome we got switch light 8 switch Enterprise 8 this is one of the inall six Enterprises Cloud key and then the little Gateway just flits into your house and ubiquities everything and then he leaves pretty good 500 what what did you do 300 down 100 up because his Wi-Fi sucks if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out the last time we collabed to debunk Wireless grounding straps yeah yeah that was that was yeah aot stupid straps or the first time we collabed to determine whether static electricity actually kills computer components yeah a follow-up video on his channel as well electroboom to go check out if you guys enjoyed this one really subscribe to this guy
