Online meetings often lack effective question-and-answer dynamics, hampering professional engagement.
This project introduces an interactive conversational agent, using Large Language Models, to enhance real-time questioning and fosters a more interactive and productive virtual meeting environment for working professionals. The goal is to streamline information retrieval and elevate the quality of online professional interactions.


## Project Highlights

- LLM based question and answer system that will use following:
  - Google Gemini-Pro LLM
  - FAISS embeddings
  - Streamlit for UI
  - Langchain framework
  - FAISS LOCAL STORE as a vector store
  - Few/One shot learning
- In the UI, the meeting participant will ask their questions in natural language, and it will produce the answers accordingly.
